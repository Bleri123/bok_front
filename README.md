Our bank system project was inspired by the need for unique and practical solutions. We recognized that a banking system could provide essential functionalities such as account management, transaction processing, and user information tracking.

This project allows us to develop key banking features, offering experience in database management and coding, while also giving us insight into the complexities of real-world financial systems.
